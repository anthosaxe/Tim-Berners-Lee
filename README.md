## futur improvement
1. few problems with responsive due to a bad management with the flexbox concept. have to make a "plan" of section/article before coding to manage it beter.
2. bad use of id/class, seen when starting with responsive.
3. beter start with mobile next time.
4. too much css line, lots of repeat.
